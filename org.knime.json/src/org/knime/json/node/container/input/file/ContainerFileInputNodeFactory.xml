	<name>Container Input (File)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Receives an external file (e.g. provided via an upload) and exposes it via a flow variable.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
            This node receives resources from an external caller (for example the
			<i>REST interface</i>) and saves them locally for use in the current workflow.
			A configured parameter makes the <i>Container Input (File)</i> visible for the
			external caller and enables the caller to send a resource to the node.
			<br/>

			<p>
				A default file can be specified that is used when the node is excuted without a resource
				from an external caller. The default file will not be moved or copied. Only the path will be exposed.
			</p>
		</intro>

        <option name="Parameter name">
            A name for the variable input parameter (preferably unique). This name is exposed in the REST interface.
			It must start with a letter, followed by letters and digits and single minus signs or dashes and must end
				with a letter.<br/>
			(The accepted pattern is descibed by the following regular expression:
			<i>^[a-zA-Z](?:[-_]?[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*(?&lt;![0-9])$</i>)
        </option>

        <option name="Append unique ID to parameter name">
			If checked, the name set above will be amended by the node's ID to guarantee unique parameter names.
			Usually it's a good idea to have this box <i>not</i> checked and instead make sure to use meaningful
			and unique names in all container nodes present in a workflow.
        </option>

        <option name="Description">
			A description for the variable input parameter. The description is shown in the API specification
			of the REST interface.
        </option>
        <option name="Variable name">
			The name of the flow variable that contains the location of the local copy of the resource.
			Any characters are allowed as long as the name is not empty.
        </option>
        <option name="Save external file at">
			Where to save the resource provided by the external caller. The two possible values are
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>workflow data area:</i> the file is saved in a temporary directory in the workflow data area.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>workflow group:</i> the file is saved in in a temporary directory in the same workflow group as
						the current workflow, i.e. next to the workflow in the KNIME explorer. Please keep in mind that
						the person that is executing the workflow has to have the permissions to create files and
						directories in the workflow group.
				</li>
			</ul>
        </option>
        <option name="Use a default file">
			Whether to use the default file given below if no external resource is given.
			An external resource will always take precedence over a default file. Only the path of a default
			file will be exposed. A default file must exist. The node will fail to execute
			if this option is disabled or the default file is invalid and no external resource is available.
        </option>
		<option name="Read from">
			Select a file system which stores the data you want to read. There are
			four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file/folder from your
					local system.
			</li>
			<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
				When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
				Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
				Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
				A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
				You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
		</li>
		<li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
			relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
			When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
	</li>
	<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol).
		When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
		In case it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.
		Browsing is disabled for this option.
</li>
				</ul>
				<!--To read from other file systems, click on
				<b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node icon followed by
				<i>Add File System Connection port</i>. Afterwards, connect the desired file system connector
					node to the newly added input port. The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
					It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
					Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
					-->
			</option>
			<option name="File, Folder or URL">
				Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file or folder. The
				required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
				File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
	            File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
	            description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
				You can also choose a previously selected file/folder from the drop-down list, or select a location
				from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
				Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
					<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
					<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
					(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
				</ul>
                <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a
                </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
				<i>path flow variable.</i></a> This is done additionally to the variable that is
					exposed via <i>Output variable name</i>.
