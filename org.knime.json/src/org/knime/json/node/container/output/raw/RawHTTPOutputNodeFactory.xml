	<name>Container Output (Raw HTTP)</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
		This node produces a raw HTTP response with headers, body, and status code configurable via the input tables
		and dialog options. The headers are sent back to the client as response headers and the body data is sent
		in the HTTP response body.

		<intro>
			<p>
				This node reads the first cell of a string or binary column from a table and
				makes its content available to an external caller as body of an HTTP Request.
				Columns from the second input table are sent as HTTP response headers.
				If no content-type header is specified in the header table, application/octet-stream is returned.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other container output nodes only offer the body data of the response to be sent in a JSON format.
				However, this "Raw HTTP Output Container" node can send arbitrary data back to the client.
				Therefore, the user is able to receive non-standard data, for example an Excel spreadsheet (*.xlsx files).
				Another use case would be to have node respond with an HTML body. The workflow could then be used to generate web pages on request.
			</p>
			<p>
				Important: There can only be one "Container Output (Raw HTTP)" node in a workflow, as it generates the response for the client.
				Additionally, this output node is only compatible with the "Container Input (Raw HTTP)" node.
				This means, no other container input node will be supported with this raw HTTP output container.
