		<intro>
            This node makes a file accessible to an external caller (for example the
			<i>REST interface</i>) by providing the path to the file as a resource. The file has
			to exist and be located in the current workflow's data area.

        <option name="Parameter name">
			A name for the variable output parameter (preferably unique). This name is exposed in the REST interface
			and will have the resource attached to it.
			It must start with a letter, followed by letters and digits and single minus signs or dashes and must end
				with a letter.<br/>
			(The accepted pattern is described by the following regular expression:
			<i>^[a-zA-Z](?:[-_]?[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*(?&lt;![0-9])$</i>)
        </option>

        <option name="Append unique ID to parameter name">
			If checked, the name set above will be amended by the node's ID to guarantee unique parameter names.
			Usually it's a good idea to have this box <i>not</i> checked and instead make sure to use meaningful
			and unique names in all container nodes present in a workflow.
        </option>

        <option name="Description">
			A description for the resource output parameter. The description is shown in the API specification
			of the REST interface.
        </option>

        <option name="File Path Variable">
			Defines the variable that contains the path to the resource to be exposed. This has to be a

			</a>
			The path must point to a file that exists, must be regular (e.g. <i>not</i> a folder) and must be contained
			in the current workflow's data area.
