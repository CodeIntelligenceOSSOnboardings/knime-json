		Makes a file in the workflow accessible to an external caller.

		<intro>
            This node makes a file accessible to an external caller (for example the
			REST interface) by providing the path to the file as a resource. It can
			then for example be downloaded after
			executing a job that isn't discarded yet. The file has
			to exist and be located in the current workflow's data area.

        <option name="Parameter name">
			A name for the output parameter (preferably unique). This name is exposed in the REST interface
			and will have the resource attached to it.
			It must start with a letter, followed by letters and digits and single minus signs or dashes and must end

        <option name="Append unique ID to parameter name">
			If checked, the name set above will be amended by the node's ID to guarantee unique parameter names.
			Usually it's a good idea to have this box <i>not</i> checked and instead make sure to use meaningful
			and unique names in all container nodes present in a workflow.

        <option name="Description">
			A description for the resource output parameter. It is currently <i>not</i> shown in the API specification
