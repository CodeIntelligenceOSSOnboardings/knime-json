    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Reads the content of a JSON column and makes it available to an external caller. This node is used
        in KNIME server web services, where the result of the web service is represented by the input of this node. By
        default a JSON array is returned, where each row of the input table is an element in the array. Table with
        no or only one row result in an array with zero or one element. This behaviour can be changed in the dialog, see
        the settings below.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Parameter Name">A name, which serves as key in the resulting JSON object. This is used to
        assert uniqueness in case multiple output results (nodes) are present in workflow.</option>
        <option name="JSON Column">The column containing the JSON result. All other columns are ignored.</option>
        <option name="Keep single-row tables simple">
          For the special case that the input table contains one row with a non-missing JSON object (<i>{...}</i>)
          this object is taken as result. Otherwise the result is wrapped into a JSON array, which is wrapped into an
          object with key "array" containing the enumeration of all elements. This happens if the table has no rows 
          or more than one, or in presence of missing values or other-typed JSON values such as arrays or primitives.
