    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Reads the content of a JSON column and makes it available to an external caller. This node is used
        in workflows deployed as REST services, where the result of the web service is represented by the input of this node.
        By default a JSON array is returned, where each row of the input table is an element in the array. Tables with
        no or only one row result in an array with zero or one element. This behavior can be changed in the dialog, see
        the settings below.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Parameter Name">A name, which serves as key in the resulting JSON object. This is used to
        assert uniqueness in case multiple output results (nodes) are present in workflow.</option>
        <option name="Append unique ID to parameter name">
        	If checked, the name set above will be amended by the node's ID to guarantee unique parameter names. Usually
        	it's a good idea to have this box <i>not</i> checked and instead make sure to use meaningful and unique
        	names in all container nodes present in a workflow.
        </option>
        <option name="JSON Column">The column containing the JSON result. All other columns are ignored.</option>
        <option name="Description">
            A description for the output parameter. The description is shown in the API specification of the REST
            interface.
        </option>
        <option name="Keep single-row tables simple">
          For the special case that the input table contains one row with a non-missing JSON value this value is taken
          as result and not wrapped into a JSON array. 
        </option>
        <option name="Example">A JSON representing an example of what output received by this node may look like.
         Mainly used for populating the "example" field of the generated OpenAPI output parameter specification, which
         is presented to end users for documentation purposes.
         The content of this node can be filled from input data (if preceding nodes are executed.)</option>
